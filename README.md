#ReduxBlog

Created this app from the [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) course.
Implemented an edit post form too, what pulls in the actual post data to the
form and on submit it prints the props to console, as API doesn't have the
update method implemented.

```
	> npm install
	> npm start
```
